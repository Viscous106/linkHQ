"""Seed idempotency against a partial / legacy DB.

The deploy crashed with `duplicate key ... ix_users_email` because the seed
guarded on user *id* while the unique constraint is on *email*: a legacy row
with a seed email but a different id slipped past the id check and got
re-inserted. This reproduces that exact state and asserts the seed reconciles
it instead of crashing.
