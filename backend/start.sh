# worker in the background (Render's free tier has no separate worker service),

# Memory: the free tier caps at 512MB. The worker uses a single-process `solo`
# pool (the default prefork pool forks one child per CPU → multiplies RAM) and
# RUN_WORKER=0 disables it entirely if the box still OOMs. The web server keeps
# one worker. For real load, move to a paid plan + a dedicated worker service.
